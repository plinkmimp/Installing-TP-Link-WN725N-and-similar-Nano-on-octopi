# DO NOT PUT THE WIFI DONGLE IN THE DEVICE BEFORE MENTIONED EXPLICITLY BELOW

#YOU NEED AN ACTIVE INTERNET CONNECTION ON THE RASPBERRY PI TO INSTALL THIS.

#You can share your windows PCs WiFi connection by temporarily sharing it.

#You will need the raspberry pi turned off. And connect an Ethernet cable to your PC and raspberry pi.

##ON YOUR PC:

#Open "Network and Sharing Center" via the wifi system tray icon.

#Select "Wireless Network Connection" to configure.

#Select "Properties", and authenticate as an Administrator.

#Uncheck the box next to "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)

#Select the "Sharing" tab, and check the box to allow other network users to connect through your Internet connection.

#Be sure "Local Area Connection" is selected from the "Home networking connection" drop-down box (if that drop-down exists).

#Click "OK" buttons until all the network configuration windows are gone.

#When you shut your Pi down, you will want to disable Internet sharing. Sometimes Windows Networking stops working properly when you don't disable it.

#To disable Internet Sharing on Windows, you only have to reverse step 5 above (uncheck the box to allow other network users to connect).

##ON YOUR RASPBERRY PI

#connect HDMI cable and power and keyboard and wait for the raspberry pi to boot. 

IT WILL REBOOT SEVERAL TIMES DURING SETUP. 

#LOGIN


# Make sure the system is up to date and all that needs to be installed is installed

"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f"

# Install some necessary packages as we will build the source firmware ourselves

"sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git"

# There is a package for raspberry pi to add the kernel headers, so you can pick one here (if one doesn't work, use the other)

"sudo apt-get install -y linux-headers"
OR
"sudo apt-get install -y raspberrypi-kernel-headers"

# reboot for changes to take effect
"sudo reboot"


## STEP 2: Get and install the firmware for TP-Link-WN725N Nano

# Download the Github package (for best support use git clone instead of zip)

# I just put this on my home folder as I am not using this RPI for any other purpose than a livecam

"git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8188eu.git"

# Go into the new folder

"cd rtl8188eu"

# Make the source for your machine

"make"

# Install the firmware that was just build for your machine

"sudo make install"

# Reboot for changes to take effect

"sudo reboot"

# Shutdown now as we need to have the usb dongle in the RPI on startup

"sudo shutdown -h now"

## STEP 3: (INSERT USB DONGLE BEFORE CONTINUING) Check if dongle is recognized by the system

# After starting your rpi check if it now recognizes your wifi dongle

"lsusb"

# This should show something like "BUS 00X …. REALTEK… RTL8188EUS… Wireless Network Adapter"

# Great your wifi dongle is now recognised. If not, you probably don't have this dongle or you need to repeat the above steps.

# Check if modules are being loaded

"lsmod"

# Search for something like "8188eu … 0"

# Check if wlan0 is present

"ifconfig -a"

# There should be quite some output next to and under `wlan0`, if there's an IP address already visible, skip all next steps it's working.

## STEP 4: Setup wifi settings

# Add wifi settings

"sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces"
# Search for "auto wlan0" at the start, if it's not there, add it
Then make a space, and add this below it. 

"allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf"

#Save with pressing  "esc key" then ": key" then "w key"
Press "enter"

#This will allow wlan at startup. afterwards enter in terminal

"sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant.service"
"restart wpa_supplicant.service"

"sudo shutdown now"

#Once shutdown, unplug the pi and remove the SD card and edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file on your PC and put in your WiFi information as usual.

#You should be good to go now  when you turn it on.
